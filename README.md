# Gesture_based_entertainer
This repository contains code of gesture based entertainer, such that when your hand is moved, it will be sensed by the camera and the movement will be represented on the screen in the form of drawing, quite similar to what you do in MS Office paint. The only difference is that the mouse is replaced by hand gesture.
